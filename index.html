    <h2>When:</h2>
    <p> September 13th 2024 @ 5pm, reception to follow</p>
    <p> Guests may arrive anytime after 3pm </p></div>

        <p> 4481 Divide Creek Rd. New Castle, Co 81647. Google will get you most of the way, then there will be signage to follow. Don't worry, we'll be hard to miss (as usual).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Dress Code:</h2>
        <h3> Please Wear White!!</h3>
        <p> The dress code is casual / semi formal. A white tee shirt and jeans is fine, anything fancier than that is also fine. Most importantly we want you to feel comfortable.. and yes seriously wear white lol!</p>
    </div>

<div>
    <h2>RSVP</h2>
    <p>Please text or leave a voicemail for Kai at 720-415-2824 no later than July 31st 2024.</p>
</div>

 <div>

    <p>We will serve BBQ and a limited drink selection. Please feel free to byob.</p>
</div>

    
<div>
    <h2>Kids are welcome!</h2>
    <p>Kids are of course welcome! We will have yard games and other entertainment, plus the ranch is super fun to explore!</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>420 Friendly</h2>
    <p>The wedding is absolutely 420 friendly, but we know not everyone coming wants to partake. There will be a designated 420 area on the ranch to ensure everyone feels comfortable. This area will also be away from the yard games and entertainment so kids are no where near it.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Clean Up</h2>
    <p>We will be having a fire the night of the wedding where we will burn any trash we can. Also keep in mind any trash brought on to the ranch will need to leave with us if it cannot be burned. Any help with this is greatly appreciated!</p>
